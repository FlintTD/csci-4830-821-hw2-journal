## Timeline

*   Started: 2016-03-01
*   Completed: TBD

I searched through github repos to find a small open source project to
contribute to. I know that big projects have a harder time merging small
users.

## The Change

I changed a misleading and self-sonflicting sentence in the README.md file.

## Progress

*   2016-03-01: Today I forked the repo and I am waiting for a response
*   from the owner. I also looked at the other pull requests and it seems
*   like this project may be dead or not actively worked on anymore because
*   There are 4 other oull requests from other people.
