## Timeline

*   Completed: TBD

I spent a lot of this time combing through Google and Github for a project that had a problem I could actually fix with any reliability and practicality.  Considering I went well overtime, I guess I never found one that fit the 'practicality' quallification.

I considered solving (https://github.com/geodynamics/vq/issues/54), but their code was complicated and, moreover, wouldn't compile after several attempts.  I relinquished this dream after hitting the deadline and deciding this endeavor was moot, both above my head and inaccessible.

I changed projects to (https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/8395) after more searching.  This project looks reasonable and do-able.

## The Change

I wanted to solve their issue directly, sussing out the "Not a directory" error on my Linux virtual box.

## Progress

*   2016-02-28: Forked the repo and failed to compile the code.  Attempted to go through the code manually and add the needed naming.
*   2016-02-29: Attempted to go through the code manually again.
*   2016-03-01: Gave up after attending class, decided to find something do-able.
*   2016-03-03: Found and forked rg3/youtube-dl, began an attempt to solve a directory bug.
