# CSCI 4830-821 HW2 Journal

## The Project

This project is a collection of the CSCI 4830-821 Authors' experience
contributing to open source software.

## Structure

The following two directories track the progress of the open source
contributions:

```
completed/
in-progress/
```

The files in the directories are of the form:

```
<GitHub username>-<GitHub project without slashes>.md
```

For example, `colagrosso-01org_tinycbor.md` means that
[colagrosso](https://github.com/colagrosso/) is working on
[01org/tinycbor](https://github.com/01org/tinycbor).

## File contents

A given file, e.g., `colagrosso-01org_tinycbor.md`, should be an account of the
experience making a change to the GitHub project, creating a pull request, and
getting it merged. It does not have to be detailed, but it should contain
anything notable, including technical and non-technical challenges. It should
also include a note of how much time both the technical and non-technical work
took up.

## Contributing

Open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) on
GitHub. This project uses the [GitHub workflow]
(https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
