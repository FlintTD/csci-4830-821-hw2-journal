## Timeline

*   Started: 2016-02-26
*   Completed: 2016-02-26

The technical work took about one hour for reading the readme (two times),
finding an error in grammar and then fixing it. The non-technical
work took about an hour and a half for finding a repository that had a 
good response time for their pull requests, finding one with something I
could contribute to and then filing the issue and waiting for the pull 
request.

## The Change

There was a word missing in the README.md file that I wanted to remedy.

## Progress

*   2016-02-26: The project owner accepted my commit.

*   2016-02-26: I found one such [repository](https://github.com/play/play).
	I then filed a [pull request](https://github.com/play/play/pull/391) that 
	fixes the missing word in the README.md.

*   2016-02-26: I looked around different repositories and tried to find
	one that, one, I would get a quick response to, and two, a repository
	that I could actually contribute to in the short week given (and shorter
	for me personally since I started a little later.)
