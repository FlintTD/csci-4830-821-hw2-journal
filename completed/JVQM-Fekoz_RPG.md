## Timeline

*   Started: 2016-02-28
*   Completed: 2016-02-29

The technical work took only thirty minutes. Changing the dialogues required 
very little effort as it is just text replacement. Finding the sections in the 
php, readme and license files which needed English corrections took the majority
of the time. Non-technical work was watching the game-play video to see the 
English problems, determining which files were seen first, and the git-hub 
request items.

## The Change

English Corrections to help out!

## Progress

*   2016-02-29: Forked the repo, made changes and sent a pull request
    After forking the repo, I began work on editing some of the initial dialogue 
    that is given to a new user along with files seen on the github repo. I filed
    a [pull request](https://github.com/Fekoz/RPG/pull/1) that corrects it. The 
    project owner accepted my changes

*   2016-02-28: I searched for any open-source projects related to gaming.
    After finding one using DHTML and PHP, I noticed there was a gameplay video in
    in the README file. After spending 15 minutes watching the gameplay video, I 
    was able to determine that there were several dialogue prompts which are given
    to new users explaining the game description and some diagnostics on the 
    community. I assumed the creator is not a native english speaker so at first
    downloaded the repo to examine the files to see check his files and test it.
